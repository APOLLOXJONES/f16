LANDING

No fixed landing speed, however keep a AoA of 11 to 13 in final.

RWR

The round display above left MFD display is a Radar Warning Reciever.
It works by sorting the threats to you.

Close to center: high threat
Close to edge: threat
Diamond: highest threat
Upper semicircle: new threat (750Hz tone)
Full blinking circle: hostile launch (2000Hz tone)
Hat above designation: Airborne

Use Link 16 in menu to define your wingmen, so they don't show up on RWR.

For something to show up in the RWR at all these conditions must be met:
1: Be a threat or unknown.
2: Be picked up by your radar OR having an active radar pointed your way OR having transponder on and not be too far away.

Notice that the RWR can sometimes pick up threat much further away than your radar is capable off.

LIVERIES

The liveries you get available depends on which variant you fly.

MFD

page SMS: J-S will jettison the selected station. Clicking on button next to a station will select it. If CAT is greater than 1, then you should set the flightcontrols to CAT III in config menu.
page RDR: B-scope radar display. Horizontal is relative bearing to targets, vertical is distance.
page VSD: Vertical situation display.
page SIT: A overview for navigation, shows route and other stuff. Once this has been shown, it will eat some framerate of your simulation.
