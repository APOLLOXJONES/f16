The General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon (nicknamed Viper by pilots) is a single-engine supersonic multirole fighter aircraft in use by the United States Air Force and exported to many countries, becoming world's most numerous fixed-wing aircraft in military service. Designed as an air superiority day fighter, it evolved into a successful all-weather multirole aircraft.
The Fighting Falcon has key features including a frameless bubble canopy for better visibility, side-mounted control stick to ease control while maneuvering, a seat reclined 30 degrees to reduce the effect of g-forces on the pilot, and the first use of a relaxed static stability/fly-by-wire flight control system which helps to make it a nimble aircraft.
